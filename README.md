## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Node.js, Express, MongoDb, Vite,JavaScript, HTML, CSS

I used node/express to build the API first to handle the request to add movies and add/remove user likes. MongoDb for data storage. Client built with React + React-Router, developed with Vite. Google oauth 2.0 for user authentication.

## Optimizations

As the site is an ongoing project to allow users to create their own personalized collection of favorite movies, in additonation to the community rankings, that they can share with frieds on social media etc..
